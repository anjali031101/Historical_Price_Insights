# Historical Price Insights

- Developed a web scraper using Python, Selenium, and Beautiful Soup to extract historical commodity price data from IndexMundi.
- Implemented and optimized a MongoDB database for efficient storage and retrieval of the processed data.
- Designed and implemented a user-friendly web interface using Flask and Bootstrap, facilitating intuitive visualization of commodity trends.
- Automated real-time updates and user interactions to empower analysts, traders, and supply chain managers with timely and actionable insights in finance and economics.

## Technologies Used: 
The project leverages the following technologies to achieve its objectives:

- Python: Python is known for its versatility in scripting, web scraping (using libraries like Selenium and BeautifulSoup), and data manipulation. It's the foundation for building the data collection and processing functionalities.

- Selenium: Handles browser interaction and retrieves data from dynamic web pages that might not be readily accessible to traditional scraping methods.

- Beautiful Soup: Parses the extracted HTML content, allowing you to pinpoint and extract the relevant data efficiently.

- MongoDB: Advantages of MongoDB in storing large datasets:
  - Flexibility: Supports various data structures, making it suitable for storing diverse commodity data.
  - Scalability: Can handle growing data volumes efficiently, ensuring smooth operation as the data collection expands.

- Flask: It is a lightweight web framework for building the user interface:
  - Rapid Development: Flask allows for quick development of web applications, making it efficient for building the user interface.
  - Easy Integration: Integrates well with Python code, simplifying the process of connecting the backend data manipulation to the user interface.

- Bootstrap: It enhances the user experience:
  - Responsiveness: Bootstrap makes the web application responsive, meaning it adjusts to different screen sizes and devices, providing a seamless experience for users.
  - Visually Appealing Design: Bootstrap offers pre-built styles and components, allowing you to create a user-friendly and visually appealing interface for data exploration.
