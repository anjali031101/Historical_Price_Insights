        The project at hand aims to develop a robust web scraping and data management system tailored for gathering, storing, 
        and presenting historical commodity data sourced from online platforms. 
        Specifically, the system focuses on retrieving and processing data spanning the last 30 years for commodities such as gold. 
        The core functionality involves web scraping using Selenium and Beautiful Soup, data storage in MongoDB, 
        and a user-friendly web interface built with Flask and Bootstrap.

        <h3>
          Project Overview:
        </h3>
        <br>
        •	Briefly introduce the project's objective: developing a web scraper for commodity price history from a target website (IndexMundi). 
        <br>
        •	Highlight the significance of commodity price data and its applications in various sectors (e.g., finance, economics, supply chain management).

        <h3>
          Technologies Used:<br>
        </h3>
        The project leverages the following technologies to achieve its objectives:<br>
        <br><b>
          Python:
        </b>
        Python is known for its versatility in scripting, web scraping (using libraries like Selenium and BeautifulSoup), and data manipulation. 
        It's the foundation for building the data collection and processing functionalities.
        <br><br><b>
          Selenium:
        </b>
        Handles browser interaction and retrieves data from dynamic web pages that might not be readily accessible to traditional scraping methods.
        <br><br><b>
          Beautiful Soup:
        </b>
        Parses the extracted HTML content, allowing you to pinpoint and extract the relevant data efficiently.
        <br><br><b>
          MongoDB:
        </b>
        Advantages of MongoDB in storing large datasets:<br>
        <b>
          •	Flexibility:
        </b> 
        Supports various data structures, making it suitable for storing diverse commodity data.<br>
        <b>
        •	Scalability: 
        </b>
        Can handle growing data volumes efficiently, ensuring smooth operation as the data collection expands.<br>
        <br><b>
          Flask:
        </b>
        It is a lightweight web framework for building the user interface:<br>
        <b>
          •	Rapid Development:
        </b>
        Flask allows for quick development of web applications, making it efficient for building the user interface.<br>
        <b>
          •	Easy Integration:
        </b>
        Integrates well with Python code, simplifying the process of connecting the backend data manipulation to the user interface.<br>

        <br><b>
          Bootstrap:
        </b>
        It enhances the user experience:<br>
        <b>
          •	Responsiveness:
        </b>
        Bootstrap makes the web application responsive, meaning it adjusts to different screen sizes and devices, providing a seamless experience for users.
        <br>
        <b>
          •	Visually Appealing Design:
        </b>
        Bootstrap offers pre-built styles and components, allowing you to create a user-friendly and visually appealing interface for data exploration.
